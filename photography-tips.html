                <h1>Bird Photography</h1>
                <p>Add a bit of creativity to your birding with a camera.  Birds are great subjects and you'll be wowed at how many details and idiosyncrasies can be captured even with basic skills and equipment.  Here are some Bird Nerd tips to get you started.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="clearfix"></div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-1 col-md-2"></div>
            <div class="col-xs 12 col-sm-10 col-md-8 border-sandwich">
                <ul class="counted">
                    <li>
                        <h2>Start small</h2>
                        <div class="container-image">
                            <img src="{{ '/images/2016-12-03-black-capped-chickadee-lg.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
                        </div>
                        <p>Since birds are shy you'll want a lens that allows you to photograph them from far away. If you're going by focal length 300mm or more will work.  Practice photographing a friendly species (e.g. chickadees or sparrows) until you're confident in your gear and camera settings.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h2>Get sharp</h2>
                        <div class="container-image">
                            <img src="{{ '/images/2017-02-26-raven-eating-lg.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
                        </div>
                        <p>Setting your camera's ISO to a high value (e.g. 800) will make learning easier.  If you can consistently capture subjects in focus you're on your way to greatness.  Fence posts, walls, tree stumps or the ground itself can also be used to steady a camera.  If you're still seeing some blurriness try a tripod.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h2>Learn lighting</h2>
                        <div class="container-image">
                            <img src="{{ '/images/2017-01-25-common-redpoll-lg.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
                        </div>
                        <p>To start with, keep the sun behind you when you shoot.  This is the easiest approach and has the fewest problems with exposure and colour saturation.  Side lighting can produce better 'modelling' (three-dimensional forms) however it's prone to harsh highlights and shadows. I leave my camera's white balance on the <em>shade</em> setting most of the time.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h2>Compose creatively</h2>
                        <div class="container-image">
                            <img src="{{ '/images/2017-01-25-downy-and-nutchatch-lg.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
                        </div>
                        <p>The amount of studying and practice needed to understand composition is immense.  Better compositions in bird photography can happen simply by deciding not to centre focus every shot. When you spot a bird, try capturing five unique pictures instead of capturing the same picture five times. Pick out the most interesting shots and delete the others.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h2>Post-process</h2>
                        <div class="container-image">
                            <img src="{{ '/images/2017-01-01-pine-grosbeak-03-lg.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
                        </div>
                        <p>Cropping, sharpening, and colour corrections are just a few of the ways the pros will improve their photographs.  Look at it this way: you can spend tens of thousands of dollars on gear or get the same benefits with Photoshop for hundreds of dollars.  Photoshop is like having the world's best camera in your bag.</p>

                    <h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
                    <p>I use a Canon 7DmII camera and a Canon 400mm f5.6 lens.  My setup is middle of the road.  Letâ€™s face it, gear makes a difference. However, does a photographer need top of the line equipment to produce incredible images?  Nope, the good news is that you don't need a caribou-sized lens to get amazing images!  Use what you have and have fun!</p>
