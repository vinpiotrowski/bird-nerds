                <h1>Bird Photography</h1>
                <p>Add a bit of creativity to your bird watching with a camera.  Birds are amazing subjects and you'll be amazed at how many details and idiosyncrasies can be captured even with basic skills and equipment.  Here are some Bird Nerd tips to get you started.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="clearfix"></div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-1 col-md-2"></div>
            <div class="col-xs 12 col-sm-10 col-md-8">
                <ul class="counted">

                    <li>
                        <h2>Start small</h2>
                        <div class="container-image">
                            <img src="{{ '/images/2016-12-03-black-capped-chickadee-lg.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
                        </div>
                        <p>Since birds are shy you'll want to get a lens that allows you to photograph them from far away; if you're going by focal length 300mm or more will work.  Practice photographing a friendly species (e.g. chickadees or sparrows) until you're happy with your results.  Post a million chickadee shots on Facebook.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h2>Get sharp</h2>
                        <div class="container-image">
                            <img src="{{ '/images/2017-02-26-raven-eating-lg.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
                        </div>
                        <p>Setting your camera's ISO to a high value (e.g. 800) will make learning easier.  If you can consistently capture subjects in focus you're on your way to greatness.  Fence posts, walls, tree stumps or the ground itself can also be used to steady a camera.  If you're still seeing some blurriness try a tripod.</p>
                    </li>


                    <li>
                        <h2>Learn lighting</h2>
                        <div class="container-image">
                            <img src="{{ '/images/2017-01-25-common-redpoll-lg.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
                        </div>
                        <p>To start with, keep the sun behind you when you shoot.  This is the easiest approach and has the fewest problems with exposure and colour saturation.  By shooting with side light, you can get better 'modelling' (three-dimensional appearance), however harsh highlights and shadows are possible.  Shooting into the light is hardest and not likely to yield good photos for the beginner.  I leave my camera's white balance on the <em>shade</em> setting most of the time.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h2>Compose creatively</h2>
                        <div class="container-image">
                            <img src="{{ '/images/2017-01-25-downy-and-nutchatch-lg.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
                        </div>
                        <p>The amount of schooling, studying, and practice needed to understand composition is immense and can't be broken down to a simple rule.  Master artists use dynamic symmetry, the golden section, and other design techniques like arabesques, gamut, coincidences, radiating lines, figure-ground relationship, ellipses and enclosure techniques.  Better compositions in bird photography can happen simply by deciding not to center focus every shot. When you spot a bird, try capturing five different pictures instead of capturing the same picture five times. Pick out the most interesting shots for post-processing and delete the others.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h2>Post-process</h2>
                        <div class="container-image">
                            <img src="{{ '/images/2017-01-01-pine-grosbeak-03-lg.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
                        </div>
                        <p>Cropping, sharpening, and colour corrections are just a few of the ways the pros will improve their photographs.  This step is often omitted from other bird photography guides but it's important.  Look at it this way: you can spend tens of thousands of dollars on gear or get the same benefits with Photoshop for hundreds of dollars.</p>
