words: "<p>We had trips that were off the charts and others where we were lucky to see more than a couple red-winged blackbirds.  We were very happy to see a Lewis's Woodpecker which our book lists as <em>very rare</em> in Alberta.  We also saw a Dunlin which was a very cool sighting and a super cute bird.</p>"

photo-descriptions: ["Common mergansers are sometimes called sawbills or fish ducks", "Northern flickers spend a lot of their time on the ground feeding on insects", "Lewis's woodpecker will often act like a fly-catcher hunting insects on the wing.  This was a lifer sighting for us", "Bill length is not the best way to differentiate short-billed and long-billed dowitchers", "When a white-faced ibis shows up every birder in the area will flock to them", "Canada geese will sometimes watch over ducklings that aren't theirs", "Some pectoral sandpipers make a round-trip migration of ~30,000km each year!", "Day-old avocets can walk, swim, and even dive to escape predators", "Dunlins are another rare sighting in Alberta because of their tendency to migrate almost non-stop through the province #lifer", "Black-necked stilts are one of the easiest shorebirds to identify", "Pelicans remind us of dinosaurs", "During breeding season willet populations moves inland to nest in grasslands and prairies near freshwater", "Semipalmated sandpipers are so small that we naturally assume they're least sandpipers at first glance", "Wilson's pharalope is the only pharalope that breeds in Alberta" ]
