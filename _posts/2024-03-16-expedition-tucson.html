words: "<p>It has been years since we travelled to go looking for birds.  On this trip we visited Tucson Arizona and we loved it.  The people were so friendly and the birds were great.  We saw our favorites like road runners, cactus wrens, and Gambel's quail.  We also saw some new lifer sightings including the northern cardinal which were stunning -- both the males and females.</p>"
