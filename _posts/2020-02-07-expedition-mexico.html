words: "<p>This was our third trip to Jalisco Mexico but only our second as birders.  Our routine was to go birding in the morning, then have coffee and breakfast, swim in the ocean to cool-off, afternoon snack (possibly ceviche), more birding, then dinner (likely tacos).  On this trip we got a stronger sense that the area is one of Mexico's premier spots for birds!  We met another birding couple and ventured out to <em>Barranca El Choncho</em>; a semi-famous canyon that follows a creek up into some grazing land and has 238 species reported on e-bird. We also birded <em>Laguna del Tule</em>, <em>Selva de Melaque--Senda Mirador</em>, and <em>Estero La Manzanilla</em>.  We saw many of the birds we were hoping to with the exception of boat-billed heron but we find it's always good to have a reason to bo back. </p>"

photo-descriptions: ["Although our guides showed belted kingfishers in the area we are pretty sure we saw ringed kingfishers instead", "The magnificent frigatebird is fairly common in the area but we almost never see them perched", "It's always cool seeing a local bird, like the great blue heron, halfway around the world", "There are lots of species in Jalisco that look similar to the western kingbird", "Some of the colours were so intense that it was tough to capture them with the camera", "Great egrets were standing on the beach watching people fish", "Painted buntings' Spanish name is colorín sietecolores which roughly means brightly coloured 7 colours", "A lifer sighting on this trip was the reddish egret which was hanging out close to a crocodile", "Brown pelicans would dive into the ocean just feet away from where we were swimming", "Grebes are great in general and the least grebe is extra cute", "Orchard orioles could reliably be found in the big flowers every morning", "Orange-breasted buntings are one of the coolest birds anywhere -- they also match our brand colours", "Squirrel cuckoos are one of the most spectacular birds we saw on our trip", "We were able to identify all the shorebirds we saw (including whimbrels) which was pretty cool", "Purple gallinules are remarkable fliers and turn up far out of their normal range quite often", "Groove-billed Ani are a tropical blackbird with a groovy bill", "Royal terns were one of a handful of species that we saw every day in the bay", "One of the oldest domesticated fowl species in the world, the muscovy duck was already being kept by native people in Peru and Paraguay when the early Spanish explorers arrived", "We thought we were watching a black and white warbler but the photos later showed a black-throated gray warbler -- another lifer!", "The male painted bunting can make the cover of birding magazines but the female is interesting as well",  "One of the many flycatchers we saw in Mexico was the social flycatcher -- at least it is easy to identify", "The two lagoons we frequently birded were populated with rather large crocodiles", "The trail-head where we'd venture into the mountains was always full of birds including stripe-headed sparrows", "Ash-throated flycatchers get all the water they need from the food they eat", "The slender snowy egret sets off immaculate white plumage with black legs and brilliant yellow feet", "We like how the grayish saltidor looks like an angry muppet"]
