words: "<p>For the first part of our Costa Rica journey we stayed at the Palo Verde Biological Station (Organization for Tropical Studies).  It was very rustic and we got lots of bug bites.  On the upside we got to eat authentic Tico meals with the local bomberos (fire fighters) and rangers staying in the park.  There were lots of birds too!  Palo Verde is near the biggest wetland in all of Central America.  The rainy season was starting to end and everything was incredibly lush and green.</p>"
