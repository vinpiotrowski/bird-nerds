words: "<p>Yep, covid-19 is still a thing and every day feels similar to the previous day.  At least the birds are changing!  There have been a lot of western tanager sightings in Calgary and, since they're one of our favorite birds, we went searching.  In our search we saw a saw-whet owl in the city and a Barrow's goldeneye as well.</p>"
