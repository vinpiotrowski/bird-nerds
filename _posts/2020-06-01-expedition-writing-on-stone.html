words: "<p>Before covid hit we had booked a camping trip to Writing on Stone and it worked out for us.  We were hoping to see a yellow-breasted chat in Alberta but we were unsuccessful.  There were a lot of great birds but some of our coolest sightings were foxes, antelopes, snakes, and skunks.  We also birded in Lethbridge which beat our expectations and visited Pakowki Lake which was bumping with lots of different species.</p>"

photo-descriptions: ["We had a group of cedar waxwings flying around us and being brave", "Flycatchers are a species we've been paying more attention to and the least flycatcher is the most common", "Grey catbirds were very common around Lethbridge and Writing on Stone", "We were expecting to see lots of warblers but only saw yellow warblers", "Lark sparrows fit with the badlands environment perfectly", "The Swainson's hawks down south looked real nice", "A violet-green swallow landed right near us but was backlit -- still a cool sighting", "A lot of people don't know that Alberta has native antelope", "One of our favorite sightings wasn't a bird on this trip but 3 young foxes", "A western wood pewee is easy to confuse with flycatchers", "Writing on Stone is famous for bull snakes and rattlesnakes", "California gulls are amazingly adaptable -- webbed feet but finding food in an A&W parking lot? Impressive!", "We got some photos of birds we don't see close up very often such as bank swallows", "In a couple fields we spotted long-billed curlews which stand out with their impossibly long bill", "Another bird we expected to see in the badlands environment were rock wrens", "American goldfinch are a crowd-pleaser with their bright colours and uplifting song", "Western kingbirds are common where we vacation in Mexico so it's neato seeing them in Alberta", "On a trip to Pakoki Lake we saw tonnes of birds including marbled godwits", " With slow, deep wingbeats, the great blue heron is a majestic sight", "Blue-winged teals look like they're wearing leopard print"]
