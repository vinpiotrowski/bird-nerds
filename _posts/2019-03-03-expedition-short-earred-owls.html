words: "<p>Winter birding around Calgary is the exact opposite of our last post from Costa Rica.  On the flight home from central america we had talked that it might be tough having a lot less birds around.  Since returning to Calgary we've been extra inspired to get out and look for birds.  Although we haven't spotted any toucans we were super excited to see snowys and shortys.  We also came by a flock of several hundred snow buntings which was awesome!</p>"
