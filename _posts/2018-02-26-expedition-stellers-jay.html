words: "<p>It has been a cold month with lots of snow.  In fact, we almost got our truck stuck in a snow bank.  The biggest highlight in these outings was seeing a Steller's jay in Kananaskis Country.  We're still on the prowl for a few types of owls and a gyr falcon before Spring rolls in but still no new lifer sightings in February.</p>"
