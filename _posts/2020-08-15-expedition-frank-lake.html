words: "<p>It looks like covid is going to continue to be a thing but at least we live near places with lots of birds.  Frank Lake is an extra special place and, with the blind closed, it appears like even more birds are showing up this year.  Black-necked stilts are listed as rare in our book (which was published in 1998) but we've seen them everywhere and on our Frank Lake trips we've seen hundreds.  It's hard to say if it's because they're making a comeback or if it's related to climate change or other factors.  Still great to see so many because black-necked stilts are awesome birds.</p>"
