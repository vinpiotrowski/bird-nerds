words: "<p>Covid-19 continues and we have been doing a lot more birding from the truck.  Birding from a vehicle isn't ideal for us but we still see a lot of birds while cruising down backroads.  On this set of trips we managed to photograph a kestrel and a harrier which are both considered hard targets.  Some of our favorite spots (eg. Frank Lake) are closed so we are cooking up new ideas while staying safe.</p>"
