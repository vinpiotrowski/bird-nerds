words: "<p>We haven't been reliable in our posting but it's okay with us.  It's nice that we're able to enjoy birding after six years and not have it feel like an obligation.  On these trips, the mammals were the stars of the show, with a badger sighting and a thirteen-lined ground squirrel sighting.  Both of which, we'd never seen before, despite living in Alberta our whole lives.</p>"
