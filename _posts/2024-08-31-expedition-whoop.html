words: "<p>Despite not birding very much lately we've been very lucky with the birds we've seen.  While out on a bike ride, Vince looked into a field and saw a whooping crane and it's a reminder why having a camera nearby is always a good idea!  The next day we went back and Sandra got to see it too!  We also had a gray-crowned rosy finch appear in our yard which was another solid lifer sighting.  We also were able to visit Ucluelet in British Columbia and had a couple camping trips which were all amazing!</p>"
