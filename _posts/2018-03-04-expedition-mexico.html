words: "<p>One of the Bird Nerd's favourite vacation destinations is the San Patricio area of Jalisco Mexico.  We've been there a couple times however this was the first time we brought our birding gear.  Turns out having rainforests, oceans, and lagoons next to each other makes for the best birding we've ever had.  We didn't hit up the areas with parrots so that will be for next time.  We did all our birding without guides and found these places by ourselves.</p>"
