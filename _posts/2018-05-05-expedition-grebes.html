words: "<p>All of the birds are back!  It's like someone flipped a switch and turned on all the birds.  We've seen many blackbirds, wrens, tree swallows, bluebirds, robins etc.  Online people are reporting tanagers and orioles.  It's also been warm out!  To top it off we spotted two new lifers -- the evening grosbeak and the horned grebe.</p>"
