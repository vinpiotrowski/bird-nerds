words: "<p>In the second half of winter we did a lot more trips where we birded from our truck.  We were specifically looking for birds of prey and saw some incredible chases and hunts.  It was very different from what we normally do but was also really cool.  We also won't disclose any of our locations after a couple owls died in local parks after being stressed -- no sighting or image is worth more than the subject and its welfare. </p>"

photo-descriptions: ["Rough-legged hawks nest in the arctic and look so cool", "Every winter we anxiously await the return of the world's largest falcon but this season was the first time we've managed to see a gyr falcon (from very far away)", "We learned to track mallards and other ducks in order to see more prey birds", "Juvenile bald eagles seem less cautious than matures but they still don't like people much (which is a good thing)", "Pointing out bald eagles to budding birders and naturalists is a good way to raise appreciation", "Snowy owls must capture the equivalent of 7 to 12 mice a day to meet their food requirements", "Prairie falcons are basically mini-gyrs which makes them awesome", "We observed multiple prairie falcons and eagles chase down waterfowl", "It was getting dark but we stop for ruffed grouse -- they're so weird"]
