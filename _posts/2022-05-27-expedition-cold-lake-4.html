words: "<p>One of the best parts about looking for warblers at the end of May is that their colours match our books so we could easily identify them.  We were back in Cold Lake to visit friends and look for birds.  This was the earliest we have been there and the timing was great!  When we arrived there was a violent storm but the next morning was one of our best outings we've had anywhere ever.  We still didn't see any male blackburnian warblers but we were lucky to see lots of other speicies including a couple lifers.  We also had a pretty magical encounter with a pair of sandhill cranes.</p>"
