words: "<p>We got on a plane for the first time in years and went to visit friends and family on Vancouver Island -- of course we did a bit of birding as well!  After that we did occasional trips out into the prairies and although we didn't have any lifers we saw a lot of our favorite birds which was awesome!</p>"
