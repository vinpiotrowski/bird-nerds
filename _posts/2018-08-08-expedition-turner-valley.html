words: "<p>One of the best parts of birding for us has been exploring Alberta.  One day we ended up taking a new turn, going down a road we had never gone down before, and we ended up in Sheep River Provincial Park.  We liked the area so much we've been back several times and camped overnight on our last trip out. We saw loads of white-winged crossbills but they wouldn't leave the tops of 100 foot tall trees so no photos.  We'll probably try again in the near future.</p>"
