words: "<p>This post is dated September 1st but it covers July - December.  So what happened?  Well it was an extremely hot summer filled with forest fires and smoke.  We also got involed in some activism and have been advocating to stop all coal exploration in the eastern slopes of Alberta.  As well we've been riding bikes and avoiding screens so it took a while to pull photos from the camera.  Anyways, despite all the distractions we had some really good outings and even saw a new lifer!</p>"

    "They used to be a fairly common sighting but American Dippers have been much rarer since the 2014 flood",
    "Flycatchers are hard to ID and we saw one that looked extremely yellow but it was probably one of the common species",
    "Juvenile wood duck",
    "Likely a semipalmated sandpiper",
    "We had our first encounter with a buff breasted sandpiper",
    "Likely a least sandpiper",
    "The hard line in colouring on the breast makes us think this is a pectoral sandpiper",
    "A little unsure but going with semipalmated sandpiper",
    "More sandpipers and some have really long bills",
    "Classic eastern kingbird",
    "We noticed the biggest mule deer buck catching some shade on a hot day",

    "Can't forget about the white-throated sparrows",
    "2021 was another stinky year"
