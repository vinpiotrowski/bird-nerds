words: <p>Back to our stomping grounds but very different places.  Kananaskis where the mountains connect us with nature then Frank Lake where we're reminded that beauty can be found where you least expect it.  By mid-August you can see and feel that migration has started.  Close to home gulls are congregating in parking lots.  We have made plans with our own vacations to visit new places during migration and are looking forward to our next trips. </p>
