words: "<p>Instead of hanging around in sloughs looking for shorebirds we visited parks and scenic trails around Calgary (the smells were better too). Every year the spring migration has variations and differences from the previous season and 2021 is no exception.  We have seen <em>a lot</em> of yellow warblers and a <em>few</em> yellow-rumped warblers but no others so far.</p>"
