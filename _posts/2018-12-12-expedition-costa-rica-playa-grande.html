words: "<p>After some rustic adventures we wanted to relax and stayed in Playa Grande for the last part of our trip to Costa Rica.  Everyone there was a surfer and it reminded us a lot of Tofino, BC in Canada.  On one of our first outings we spotted a motmot and it made our day.  After that any other birds we spotted were just a bonus.  We took a boat into a nearby mangrove estuary, visited Tamarindo (too touristy for us), and sat on the beach watching sunsets.  It really was the perfect way to end a great trip!  </p>"
