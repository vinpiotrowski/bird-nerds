words: "<p>Vancouver Island was sunnier and warmer than we've ever seen it.  We were grateful to see some green and sunshine but at the same time it felt unnatural not to have chilliness and dampness.  It was Sandra's birthday and we had a great trip with lots of family & friend visits and tasty meals.  For birds we were happy to see warblers and swallows which represent the arrival of Spring and we had close encounters with Steller's jay.</p>"
