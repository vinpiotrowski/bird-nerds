words: "<p>We had a few trips in late fall 2018.  On these trips we were looking for very specific birds which means that sometimes you might see very few species. For example we still haven't seen any gyr falcons but we'll keep looking.  We did have a good day out near Carseland and another good evening in Fish Creek Provincial Park. A couple of really rare warblers were seen in Calgary and Canmore but we missed both.</p>"
