words: "<p>Like many Canadians the Bird Nerds have friends and family living on Vancouver Island and we like to visit them.  In between trips to restaurants and pubs we will sneak away and do some birding.  This trip was solid with several lifer sightings.  We tried to hit up parks that were on the ocean hoping to see some oceanic birds that we wouldn't likely see in Alberta.  Although we didn't spot anything unusual it was still fun to spend time staring out at the Pacific.</p>"
