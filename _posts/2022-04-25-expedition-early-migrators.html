words: "<p>In the last few weeks we have been doing roadtrips (usually south of Calgary) to catch some of the early migrators.  It was great seeing and hearing our first meadowlarks of the season.  Mountain bluebirds, robins, and wood ducks also get us pretty excited.  Although we didn't see anything unusual it was still lots of fun.</p>"
