words: "<p>Happy new year!  We haven't been birding much and it has been making us unhappy.  In order to rectify the situation we started going to Weaselhead, which is where we started birding 5 years ago, and the combination of nostalgia and the outdoors lifted our sprits.  We were thrilled when we saw a pair of male evening grosbeak.  It was our best sighting of that bird so far and we didn't have to go far for it.  A solid reminder for us that getting outside is never a bad way to spend time.</p>"
