words: "<p>Ring the bell, school's back in!  It's also the time of year when bird migration gets serious. It's been tricky balancing birding, bike rides, hikes, and other outdoor activities as we try to get the most out of summer 2020.  We headed to Cold Lake again (our third trip) and had an amazing time and saw lots of great birds (and the Northern Lights too)!  We checked the backroads around Beaverhill but didn't see many shorebirds yet. We did glimpse a few flocks of cranes so things are moving.</p>"
