words: "<p>Things continue to be crazy in Alberta and the world because of covid-19.  The situation has changed the way we look for birds but birding has been a welcome distraction for us.  Even though the current closures feel restrictive, they're important, and we still have lots of reasons to be appreciative and the variety of birds near home has been surprising.</p><p>We had some really good trips in the last few weeks and saw a super rare vagrant!  The tufted duck has only been spotted in Alberta once before and we were extremely lucky see it.  On top of that it's getting warmer out, spring is on its way, and every day more birds are arriving in Alberta.</p>"

photo-descriptions: [Sharp-tailed grouse's natural tendency is to hide, The sharp-shinned hawk is the smallest hawk in Canada, Robins are comfortable in the wilderness even though most people think of them as a city dwellers, In California some magpies have a bright yellow bill, Brown creepers are energetic birds and we have never seen one resting, This was the first year we have seen mountain bluebirds in the snow, Northern shrike's mask doesn't extend over the eye or bill like a loggerhead's does, Horned larks have a lot of neat markings when you see them up close, The common goldeneye is a great duck and we are happy to see them back in the province, Green-winged teals are among the most speedy and maneuverable waterfowl, With underwater vision and sealed nostrils cormorants are built for aquatic mastery, Red-tailed hawks are mostly pale below with dark bits around the tips and edges.  They also have a dark belly band, Red-breasted mergansers look crazed and are a fairly rare sighting in Alberta, Tufted ducks wander to the Pacific Coast from Asia but have only been sighted in Alberta once before (in 1993)]
