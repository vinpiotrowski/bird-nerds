words: "<p>It's that part of the year where people are reflective and we're disappointed with the amount of birding we did in the last part of the year.  In December we went looking for very specific birds (ptarmigans, nutcrackers, and gyr falcons) which we knew would reduce the amount of birds we would see overall.  The trips were great though and the scenery in the mountains is incredible!  We also saw a new species of grouse and finally had a good encounter with a dipper!  We will likely continue to search for new birds in the mountains in the new year because we're enjoying the adventure so much!</p>"
