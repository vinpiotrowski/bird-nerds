words: "<p>Since we became birders a major hope of ours has been to see a blackburnian warbler.  It's not very common and it only shows up in a small part of Alberta.  This was our fifth trip to Cold Lake and we finally had an undisputable sighting!  It was an instant highlight of our birding careers.</p><p>We love going to Cold Lake because it's so natural and remote.  We will keep going there for sure.  At the end of this trip we spent a night in Sir Winston Chruchill Provincial Park which was also spectacular.</p>"
