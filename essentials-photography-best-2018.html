            <h1>Best of 2018: Photography</h1>
            <p>Following with a tradition we started in 2017 we compiled a list of some of our favorite photos.  It's in no particular order and our criteria was mainly subjective.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-3">
                <h2>Mountain bluebird</h2>
                <p>Mountain bluebirds signify the end of winter on the prairies and their return makes people happy.  It is rare we see them sitting in trees; especially posed this nicely.</p>
            </div>

                <h2>Roseate spoonbill</h2>
                <p>On a trip to the Pacific coast in Mexico we got a tip about where to find roseate spoonbills. When we peered through bushes and saw a lagoon covered in pink birds we were blown away.</p>

                <h2>Burrowing owl</h2>
                <p>The high point of our summer had to be spotting wild burrowing owls in Alberta.  We had spent weeks scanning fields and we literally freaked out when we spotted them. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-sm-3">
                <h2>Hooded oriole</h2>
                <p>The colours and contrast in oriole's plumage make them great photo subjects.  While in Mexico we spotted a hooded oriole that had been eating flowers and was covered in pollen.</p>

                <h2>Anna's hummingbird</h2>
                <p>In our travels we spotted lots of hummingbirds but our best photos happened during our Arizona trip.  The lighting, pose, and colours in this photo made it one of our favourites of 2018.</p>

                <h2>Nuthatch</h2>
                <p>Although the white-breasted nuthatch is very common in Alberta we're always happy to see them.  Conditions were perfect when we bumped into a super friendly group of nuthatches in Carseland Alberta.</p>

                <h2>Aracari</h2>
                <p>Toucans are one of the most visual birds on Earth and the collared aracari takes it to the next level.  They were one of our favorite birds we saw in Costa Rica where we spotted 76 new lifers.</p>

                <h2>Redstart</h2>
                <p>One of our favorite Alberta trips was to Cold Lake.  We didn't have the best conditions for photos but we did get good looks at a lot of cool warblers and songbirds.</p>

                <h2>Parakeet</h2>
                <p>Our first good sighting of a bird from the parrot family happened in Costa Rica!  The orange-fronted parakeet has great markings too!  We also spotted 3 other parrot species on our trip.</p>

                <h2>Yellow-headed blackbird</h2>
                <p>A lot of our favorite pictures of 2018 featured perched birds so we tossed in an action shot.  The yellow-headed blackbird is popular among birders because they're obviously awesome!</p>

                <h2>Ferruginous hawk</h2>
                <p>The ferruginous hawk is the largest that visits Alberta and they're considered at-risk.  They have the classic raptor look and are striking when you spot them perched or flying on the prairies.</p>

                <h2>Bunting</h2>
                <p>Our jaws hit the ground when we first spotted the insane colours of the orange-breasted bunting (which is endemic to Mexico).  The contrast between the desaturated grass and the bird made this pic a favorite.</p>
