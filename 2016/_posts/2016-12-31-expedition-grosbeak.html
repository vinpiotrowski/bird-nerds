words: <p>It was the archetype of a perfect Winter day when we set out down the Weaselhead. Two minutes into our hike we saw a tree full of pine grosbeak. It quickly became apparent that someone had been spreading seed on the main trail. We saw an abundance of birds but had mixed feelings about the situation.</p>

photo-descriptions: ["Pine grosbeak are the largest and rarest of the 'winter finches'.", "This squirrel was gnawing away on a pine-cone.", "The rising and falling flight style differentiates the downy from many woodpeckers.", "The tameness and slow moving behavior of the pine grosbeak gave rise to local name in Newfoundland of 'mope'.", "Winter flocks of pine grosbeak may stay near a tree with abundant fruit until all of it is consumed.", "The downy woodpecker eats foods that larger woodpeckers cannot reach such as insects living on or in the stems of weeds."]
