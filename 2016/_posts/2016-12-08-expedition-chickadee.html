year: 2016
weather: sunny
temperature: -13
words: <p>The mercury was plunging past -30°C so when we saw warmer temperatures in the forecast we made sure to get outside; turns out that minus thirteen will still freeze your toes but we saw a lot of neat birds. The following day we went to the Inglewood Bird Sanctuary and saw our first eagles of the season.</p>
