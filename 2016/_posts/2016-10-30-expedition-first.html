words: <p>The Bird Nerds (consisting of Vince and Sandra) have determined that birds are the best! We joined up with a Nature Calgary field trip and were instantly hooked. We broke off from the group and started venturing out on our own but weren't diligent about taking notes or recording conditions. During this time, we checked out places like The Weaselhead Wildlife Area, Frank Lake, Fish Creek Park, Brown Lowery Park, Ralph Klein Park, and Elliston Park. Although we didn't have notes we were taking photos:</p>

photo-descriptions: ["Although the great grey owl is the tallest American owl it's not the toughest.", "The mallard is the ancestor of nearly all domestic duck breeds.", "The black-billed magpie frequently picks ticks from the backs of large mammals.", "The killdeer is usually the first shorebird a person will spot.", "Unless you’re in the arctic, don’t look for tundra swans in the summer.", "Brown creepers hitch upward in a spiral around tree trunks and limbs.", "The largest nuthatch, white-breasted nuthatches are still a small bird.", "Black-capped chickadees seldom remain at feeders except to grab a seed to eat elsewhere."]
