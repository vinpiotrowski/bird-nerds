words: "<p>Before we became serious birders we had a copy of 'Birds of Alberta' by Chris Fisher and John Acorn on our shelf. The field guide has accompanied us on practically all of our adventures and provided tonnes of knowledge.  On our latest adventure we visited some of the remote places mentioned in the guide: Elk Island NP, Beaverhill Lake, Pakowki Lake, & Writing on Stone PP.  Visiting these places felt like a rite of passage and helped us realize that we are serious birders now.  We also did a quick spin into Saskatchewan and checked out lakes near Morse and Chaplin.</p>"
