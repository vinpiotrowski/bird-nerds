words: <p>We visited some of our favorite birding spots in August.  Kananaskis where the mountains connect us with nature then Frank Lake where we're reminded that beauty can be found where you least expect it.  By mid-August you can see and feel that migration has started.  Close to home gulls are congregating in parking lots and we're already starting to notice shorebirds hanging around in wetlands.  We're plotting new adventures for this migration season and we're pretty excited!</p>

photo-descriptions: ["Look at its little hands!", "We try to be mindful and appreciate all the birds we see -- even the sparrows.", "Grey jay, Canada jay, and whiskey jacks are all the same bird.", "Osprey are neither hawks nor eagles.", "What would a trip to Kananaskis be without seeing ravens?", "Bald eagles convey power when you see them in the wild.", "Marmots are big and loud.", "We saw many baby marsh wrens at Frank Lake.", "Soras are extremely skittish even when they don't sense danger.", "It's easy to forget just how small least sandpipers are.", "Lesser yellowlegs at Frank Lake.", "The dark legs, long wings, and slightly thinner more pointed bill helps us ID Baird's sandpiper.", "Still one of the strangest birds we see in our province.", "At a glance plover look a lot like a killdeer."]
