words: "<p>Cold Lake is an awesome place in Alberta and we've had good times on every trip.  The place is famous for warblers and it held up to its reputation again.  We had a hike-in tenting campsite which was beautiful and secluded.  There was even a family of chestnut-sided warblers and pileated woodpeckers right next to our tent.  We saw lots of warblers but no blackburnians which just gives us reason to keep going back.</p>"
