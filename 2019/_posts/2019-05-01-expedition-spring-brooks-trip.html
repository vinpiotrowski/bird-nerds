words: "<p>The weather was really nice for most of April and we made sure to get out and do some birding.  It was great seeing some of our favorite species return to Alberta.  We had some really good luck at Inglewood Bird Sanctuary with wood ducks and had a lot of fun in Brooks Alberta which seems to be turning into an annual trip.  We looked up in Weaslehead one day and a flock of Bonepart's gulls were flying overhead which was our only lifer sighting this month.</p>"
