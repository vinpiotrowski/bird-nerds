words: "<p>We only have a couple years of birding experience but it's been an odd season so far.  Maybe something happened to change migration patters, like the Californian forest fires, or maybe it's just variation in each season.  We have seen way more western tanagers near Calgary than normal.  We also have not seen very many killdeer compared to previous years.  It was cool to see some of our favourites return to Alberta like the white-faced ibis at Frank Lake and a pair of common loons near Water Valley.</p>"
