words: <p>Although Spring is supposed to be around the corner it has been bitterly cold in Calgary. Despite the inclement weather a few migratory birds have started showing up at the Inglewood Bird Sanctuary. We've spotted european starlings and gulls but the bald eagles are still hanging around too. Hopefully it starts to warm up soon.</p>
