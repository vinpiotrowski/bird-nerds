words: "<p>In February we attended a field trip with Nature Calgary called the <em>Snowy Owl Prowl</em>. It was a fun day! We drove around on farm roads between Calgary and Strathmore looking for snowy owls. A couple of weeks later we retraced the route on a solo mission. We found a couple snowies and a few other cool raptors.</p>"
