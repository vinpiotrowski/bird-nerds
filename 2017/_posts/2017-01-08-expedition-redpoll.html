words: "<p>It was properly cold when we set out into the Weaselhead. We hurried down to the bridge where we discovered a bird nerd first sighting: the common redpoll. We watched them for a couple minutes then ran back to the vehicle before hypothermia set in. Even though we were only out for about 45 minutes we saw a lot of birds.</p>"
