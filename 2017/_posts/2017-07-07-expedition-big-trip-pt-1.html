words: <p>Part one of our big July trip took place in Waterton National Park. It was incredible!  We went with a group from Nature Calgary and stayed in an old church camp.  There were cabins and cooks; basically it felt like scouts.  The other people in the group showed us around and taught us about botany and gave us some great birding tips.  The amount of biodiversity in Waterton is so abundant that we decided to post more than just bird photos.  We were hoping to see (and did see) Steller's jays, lazuli buntings, and sandhill cranes on this leg of the trip.   We're already thinking about next year.</p>
