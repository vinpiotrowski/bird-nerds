words: <p>On recent expeditions we made serious attempts to see burrowing owls but haven't been successful.  Instead of more half-baked endeavors we decided to go all in.  We were sure that driving down back roads in prime habitat at 6am would get some results but it wasn't our day.  Luckily, we were near Kinbrook Island Provincial Park and we got to see many other birds.</p>
