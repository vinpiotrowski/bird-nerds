words: <p>Birding is about more than just looking for birds -- it's a chance to get outside and reconnect with nature. It's also a great excuse for exploring new parks and neighborhoods. This week we visited Griffith Woods in Discovery Ridge and found a great new space that's close to home. One morning at the Inglewood Bird Sancutary we spotted a couple of cedar waxwings performing a courtship ritual which was amazing to see! There are also tonnes of babies and ducklings around and they're always entertaining to watch.</p>
