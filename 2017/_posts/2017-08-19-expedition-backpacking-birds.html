words: <p>For this adventure, the Bird Nerds packed their binoculars and cameras in 40 liter backpacks, and trekked deep into the forest to sleep under the stars.  Our trip took us to Wedge Pond, Upper Kananskis Lake, Rawson Lake, Barrier Lake, and Mt. Lorette Ponds.  We saw lots of species that are more common in the mountains which was really neat.  It was also Sandra's first backpacking trip and she camped like a champ.</p>
