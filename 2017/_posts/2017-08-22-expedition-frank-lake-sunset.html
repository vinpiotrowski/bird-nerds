words: <p>The sun is setting on summer and it feels like a bunch of our friends are about to go on a long vacation.  In the city, the crows and gulls are forming giant flocks, which reminds us that they'll be leaving soon.  On the upside, the end of August is full of chances to sight birds as they head south.  We went to Frank Lake one evening and saw lots of shorebirds that have started their migrations.  We sat by the shore and watched 6 different species while the sun set.</p>
