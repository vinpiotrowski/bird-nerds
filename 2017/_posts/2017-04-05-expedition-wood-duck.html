words: "<p>It felt like we hadn't been to the Inglewood Bird Sanctuary in a couple days so we went there on one of our after work expeditions. As soon as we arrived at the first pond we noticed something very unusual: a pair of wood ducks! It was a big moment for the Bird Nerds because of the wood duck's rarity and their amazing colours! Very cool sighting!</p>"

photo-descriptions: ["The Bird Nerds think magpies are one of the most aesthetic local birds.", "Male mallards don’t quack; they make a quieter rasping sound.", "Wood Ducks live in low forests, marshes, and beaver ponds.", "American robins can be found stalking earthworms on the ground.", "Swimming low, just grazing the surface, is a courtship display.", "Commong goldeneye tend to forage in fairly shallow waters.", "Canada geese like places with unobstructed views to see approaching predators.", "Beavers use their tails to slap the water as a warning of danger.", "Killdeer will fake a broken wing to distract predators."]
