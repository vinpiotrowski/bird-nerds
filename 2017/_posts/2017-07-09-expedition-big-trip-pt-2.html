words: <p>After visiting Waterton National Park we headed East to Cypress Hills Provincial Park.  The campgrounds in Cypress Hills are beautiful.  We birded Elkwater Lake but didn't see too much.  In the evening we drove out into the prairies and saw many birds situated on fence posts and in the fields.  On our last morning we went searching for wild turkeys but it was extremely foggy and we didn't see much again.  Despite the lower bird counts in the actual campground we're definitely going to go back to the area in the future.</p>
