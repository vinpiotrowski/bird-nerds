words: <p>After visiting Waterton National Park we headed East to Cypress Hills Provincial Park.  The campgrounds in Cypress Hills are beautiful.  We birded Elkwater Lake but didn't see too much.  In the evening we drove out into the prairies and saw many birds situated on fence posts and in the fields.  On our last morning we went searching for wild turkeys but it was extremely foggy and we didn't see much again.  Despite the lower bird counts in the actual campground we're definitely going to go back to the area in the future.</p>

photo-descriptions: ["The American goldfinch is a strict vegetarian and doesn't eat insects.", "At the end of summer nearly the whole Swainson's hawk population will fly as far South as Argentina.", "Male song sparrows like to perch at eye-level to sing.", "This Wilson's snipe was really friendly and we dubbed it 'Snipey'.", "Yellow warblers are common but still one of our favourite summer wood birds.", "Chipmunk-o-sarus goes roar!", "The red-naped sapsucker drills a series of wells in trees to attract insects.", "A favorite meal of the upland sandpiper is grasshoppers.", "Sprague's pipits may look like a meadowlark at a glance but they're more uncommon (actually, I think this is a meadowlark).", "Barn swallows do not form mass colonies like other swallows.", "The face markings of the horned lark can quickly differentiate it from longspurs.", "When this bird flushed we saw orange tail feathers which helped lead to an ID.", "Pronghorn antelope can reach speeds of 65 kph.", "Right before it dived, this short-eared owl looked directly at us, as if to say 'watch this'.", "Even though we have northern flickers in our backyard they're always great to see on the road.", "As we left Cypress Hills we saw this turkey vulture in a heavy fog. We spotted 4 on our trip which was super cool."]
