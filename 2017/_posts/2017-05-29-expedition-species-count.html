words: <p>This expedition had a scientific purpose -- the data we collected would be used by bird researchers and bird enthusiasts as part of the May species count. Our team included Sandra &amp; Vince plus Darlene S (leader), Marion M, and Diana M. We were out for about 6 hours, with a short break for lunch, and identified over 40 species in Inglewood Bird Sanctuary and Pearce Estate Park areas. Many of our trips seem to develop a theme and this one can be referred to as 'twilight zone'. We saw ducks sitting in trees, magpies chasing bats, and harlequin ducks floating through the city. It was a lot of fun and it felt rewarding to participate in citizen science.</p>
