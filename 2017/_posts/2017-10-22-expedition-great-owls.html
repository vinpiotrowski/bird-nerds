words: "<p>On this set of trips we saw a great grey owl, a great horned owl, and a great egret.  All and all, it was pretty great!  We had some really incredible outings filled with smells of Autumn, crunchy leaves, and that crisp Alberta air.  One of our goals was to see snow geese, which we did, but we didn't get post worthy photos.  It's also getting close to our 1 year birdiversary so we've been reflective and will write a post looking back on our first year of birding soon!</p>"
