words: <p>This week we headed East for some multi-day birding near a prairie lake. It was the first long-distance trip we've taken specifically to go look at birds (although at one point a hot tub happened). The weather was great and we had a blast wandering around the near-empty Kinbrook Island Provincial Park campground. Highlights included seeing several raptors and an out of place northern shrike. We didn't see a single chickadee which felt strange because they've been constant on our other expeditions.</p>
