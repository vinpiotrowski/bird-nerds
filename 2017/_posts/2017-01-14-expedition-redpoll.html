words: <p>The Weaslehead Wildlife Area is quickly turning into one of our favorite spots for birding. We were reunited with a large group of common redpoll on this outing. It was the first time we'd seen redpolls in a flock. The flock exhibited different behavior than individuals. The next day we ventured into Carburn Park but didn't enjoy it as much because of all the noise. </p>

photo-descriptions: ["Young chickadees sometimes move large distances, but these movements are irregular and are called 'irruptions'.", "On a roughly 2-year cycle, redpolls come far south in winter and occasionally reach the central or southern United States.", "Most people in North America get to see common redpolls only in the winter.", "Downy woodpeckers are the most likely woodpecker species to visit a backyard bird feeder.", "A large, unwary finch, pine grosbeak make periodic winter irruptions into southern Canada and northern United States.", "Downy woodpeckers are small versions of the classic woodpecker body plan.", "Black-billed magpies' primary vocalizations are a harsh ascending call and a raspy chatter.", "The northern flicker prefers to find food on the ground."]
