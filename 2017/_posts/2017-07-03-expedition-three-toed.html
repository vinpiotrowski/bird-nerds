words: <p>A short drive can completely change the type of birds you see in Alberta.  On this expedition we headed West of Calgary into the foothills, along highway 8, and into Brown-Lowery Provincial Park.  We were looking for three-toed woodpeckers and found six!  We also saw some warblers, phoebes, and vireos which seem to be way more abundant on the West side of Calgary.</p>
