words: "<p>In our field guide (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2071181.Birds_of_Alberta\">Birds of Alberta</a>) it lists Beaverhill Lake as the best spot to see about 20 different sandpipers.  The book was right!  We camped about 60 kilometers away in Elk Island National Park on Astotin Lake.  The area was beautiful and packed with songbirds. While birding near our campsite we observed the concept of bird pockets -- basically we'd see almost nothing and then come across 20+ birds hanging out in the same grove of trees. During this trip we ended up spotting 4 different species of heron which turned into the theme for this expedition.</p><br /><p>QUESTION: Can you name the 4 different species of heron in the pictures? (answer below).</p>"
