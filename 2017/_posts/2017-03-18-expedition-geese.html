words: "<p>The plan was to hit our three favorite birding places in one weekend: the Weaselhead, the Bird Sanctuary, and Fish Creek Park. We managed, but when we got to Fish Creek Park the trails were flooding (from the melting snow) and there was hazardous ice everywhere so we bailed. Spring must be here because we saw a lot of birds acting crazy! We also spotted our first American robin.</p>"
