words: "<p>After seeing people posting warbler photos from Confederation Park and Mallard Point in Calgary we decided to investigate.  At the end of August birds will travel north to south and many enthusiasts have spotted warblers in these two parks.  Reports of blackburnian, chestnut-sided, and palm warblers have occurred but we weren't so lucky.  On a trip to Fish Creek Park we did manage to have a really good sighting of a peregrine falcon which made up for it! </p>"
