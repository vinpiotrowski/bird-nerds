words: <p>Symptoms of bird nerd fever include packing your camera and binoculars on errands, walks and bike rides <em>just in case</em>. This post is a collection of sightings of that nature. Our favorite encounter was spotting a lone harlequin duck on the Elbow River during a harlequin search mission. We heard they liked fast moving water but were still surprised when we found one swimming in the class IV rapids above Elbow Falls. We decided that harlequins are great -- both visually and because of their sense of adventure!</p>
