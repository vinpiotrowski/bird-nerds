words: <p>The area around High River is really great for birding. On these trips we spend more time in our vehicle and when we're on foot we instantly get swarmed by mosquitoes. On top of that the smells aren't always pleasant around stagnant water. So why do we do it? The wetlands in the area contain some of the most unique birds in Alberta such as the white-faced ibis and black-necked stilt. Also, while driving between the different lakes, sloughs and marshes the rural prairies can be stunning.</p>
