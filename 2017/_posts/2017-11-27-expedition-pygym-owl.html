words: "<p>We started targeting winter species in November such as ptarmigan, falcons, and owls.  Although we didn't get out as much as we'd like we had a few really cool sightings.  Highwood pass was on our list of birding locations but we didn't have much luck and now the road is closed; we'll need to find another place for ptarmigan.  No new species were sighted.</p>"
