words: "<p>The end of the season brings about mixed feelings.  On one hand we're seeing some really neat birds; on the other hand the quantity of birds is much lower.  A highlight was spotting a saw-whet owl in daylight up close in Brown Lowery Provincial Park.  Another highlight was spotting a Towsend's warbler before the end of season at wedge pond.  Chances are we won't see many more warblers this season.</p>"
