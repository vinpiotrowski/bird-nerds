words: <p>One of the unexpected benefits of birding is revisiting places from your childhood and seeing them in a new way. It turns out that the campgrounds and parks our families used to go camping in are really nice locations to see birds. We took the back roads between Nanton and Stavely and eventually ended up in the Willow Creek campground. Not only were the sights and smells nostalgic but we also saw a lot of neat birds including a few first sightings.</p>
