words: <p>After two nights in Cypress Hills Provincial Park we decided to finish our adventure with a single night in Dinosaur Provincial Park.  We really enjoyed our visit but were happy for the shorter stay.  The amount of mosquitoes in the campground were insane -- even wearing bug nets we still received loads of bites.  As well, Vince also got warned by a rattlesnake!  We had a few target birds on our list including cuckoos, brown thrashers, and burrowing owls.  It looks like the burrowing owl is going to be a Bird Nerds 'hard target'!</p>

photo-descriptions: ["The lighting was bad but we felt that our first sighting of a prairie falcon was super cool.", "This Eurasian collared-dove was the first bird we've seen that isn't in our book.", "Our assessment is that this is a least flycatcher chick.", "The violet-green swallow winters in Mexico and Central America.", "We did a lot of second takes on the juvenile robins thinking they were something else.", "The spotted towhee is a large striking sparrow of sun-baked thickets.", "The name rusty is applicable to this bird's fall colours and its song.", "Common yellowthroats live in thick tangled vegetation in a wide variety of habitats.", "One of our favorite sightings on the trip was the lark sparrow -- they fit the area perfectly.", "House wrens have a longer tail than winter wrens.", "One of the birds we hoped to see on this trip was the brown thrasher and we saw many.", "Yellow birds can be tricky because the female yellow warbler, Wilson's warbler and orange-crowned warbler all look similar.", "We're always proud of ourselves when we spot common nighthawks sleeping during the day.", "We drove around for hours looking at gopher mounds searching (unsuccessfully) for burrowing owls."]
