words: <p>After two nights in Cypress Hills Provincial Park we decided to finish our adventure with a single night in Dinosaur Provincial Park.  We really enjoyed our visit but were happy for the shorter stay.  The amount of mosquitoes in the campground were insane -- even wearing bug nets we still received loads of bites.  As well, Vince also got warned by a rattlesnake!  We had a few target birds on our list including cuckoos, brown thrashers, and burrowing owls.  It looks like the burrowing owl is going to be a Bird Nerds 'hard target'!</p>
