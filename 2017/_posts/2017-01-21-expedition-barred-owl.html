words: <p>Going out with local birding groups, such as Nature Calgary, is a great way to socialize and see more birds. What a group loses in the extra noise created, it makes up for by having more spotters. The highlight of this expedition was seeing a northern pygmy owl. We even got to see it's special 'concealment pose' when a hawk flew overhead. On top of that we saw a record setting 17 species in one trip!</p> <p>Before the trip we heard rumors about a barred owl hanging out in the Weaselhead Wildlife Area so we sought it out and managed to find it!</p>
