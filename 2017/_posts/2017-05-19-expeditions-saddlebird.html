words: <p>New communities in Calgary are built with storm ponds in them to help prevent flooding. Some of these storm ponds are quite established now and have a lot of cool birds in them. We hit up one storm pond in the community of Saddleridge and saw a good variety of species and a large quantity of birds concentrated in a small area. These are great places to see a lot of birds.</p>
