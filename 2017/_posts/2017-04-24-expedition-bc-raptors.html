words: <p>All things nerdy have an associated camp (band camp, space camp, dungeons and dragons camp). For Sandra and Vince, the ultimate in bird nerdery is raptor camp! We spent an entire day at <a href="http://pnwraptors.com/">The Raptors</a> in British Columbia, flying raptors, feeding them, and learning tonnes! On a walk with Anakin (a Harris hawk), the bird swooped down and caught a small rabbit. Even though the event was fairly violent it was neat to witness a raptor's natural behavior up close. We also visited some trails and parks in search of wild BC birds on this trip.</p>
