words: "<p>Some after work birding turned into one of our craziest expeditions so far! There was an abundance of activity in the Weaselhead with northern flickers making noise and downys everywhere. We also saw beavers, squirrels, chipmunks, hares, and deer (so basically all the mammals). We saw two new species: dark-eyed junco and American tree sparrow.</p>"
