            <h1>Best of 2017: Photography</h1>
            <p>Here is a curated list of our favorite photos from 2017.  We chose the photos based on their aesthetic merits rather than the rarity of the subject matter or the experience.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="counted">

        <div class="item clearfix">
            <div class="col-sm-9 container-pull-right">
                <div class="container-image">
                    <img src="{{ '/images/2017-03-24-blue-jay-lg.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />

            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-3">
                <h2>Blue Jay</h2>
                <p>Although they're quite common, and sound horrible, this blue jay was posed perfectly.  The light is slightly flat but has a nice metallic quality and highlighted the vibrancy of the bird's plumage.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="item clearfix">
            <div class="col-sm-9">

            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-3">
                <h2>Sharp-tailed Grouse</h2>
                <p>These grouse are visually spectacular and catching their courtship ritual before sunrise was something to behold.  Hello, National Geographic, sure we'll write an article for you.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="item clearfix">

            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-3">
                <h2>Great Grey Owl</h2>
                <p>The reason why we like this photo is because the owl isn't sitting on a fence-post or telephone pole; instead we encountered this great grey in an old-growth forest.</p>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div class="item clearfix">

            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-3">
                <h2>California Gulls</h2>
                <p>It's strange seeing gulls in the snow which makes this photo stand out.  We also liked how this one showed a group of birds rather than an individual.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-sm-3">
                <h2>Cedar Waxwings</h2>
                <p>Another shot for the nature enthusiast.  These waxwings were performing a courtship ritual where they pass a berry back and forth and hop around.  Waxwings are one of the most striking birds in Alberta.</p>

                <h2>Grey Jay</h2>
                <p>This grey jay cooperated and gave us an excellent pose.  With the background of an old-growth forest and the warm light spilling into the scene this is a personal favorite from 2017.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-3">
                <h2>Bittern</h2>
                <p>Bitterns are extremely good at not being seen but we startled this one by accident.  We quickly backed off and turned around but snapped a couple very unique photos during the incident.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-sm-3">
                <h2>Pine Grosbeak</h2>
                <p>These birds are very beautiful on their own, with their incredible red plumage.  We really liked the negative space in this image and the single branch leading the eye to the subject matter.</p>
            </div>

                <h2>Canada Goose</h2>
                <p>One of our favorite artists is Charley Harper and this picture reminded us of one of his works.  A very unique perspective.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-3">
                <h2>Yellow Warbler</h2>
                <p>The bird and the palette speak of warm days and Summer.  These little birds move around pretty quickly too and this photo took a lot of patience.</p>
