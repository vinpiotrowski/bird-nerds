words: "<p>One of the places on our bucket-list was Cold Lake Alberta because it is one of the best places to see a blackburnian warbler.  The provincial park is beautiful and filled with birds.  The thing about warblers is they hang out in the densest scrub brush and move around a lot making them incredibly challenging to photograph.  We saw several lifer warblers and we got a 2 day reprieve from the smoke that has been plaguing the province this Summer.</p>"

photo-descriptions: ["Cold Lake sees some rare gulls but the ring-billed gull is extremely common.", "We thought we had sighted something amazing but we talked to our 'gull guy' and learned this is a first-year Franklin's gull.", "Magnolia Warbler in Cold Lake Provincial Park.", "BPD means better photo desired. When photographing warblers you get a lot of BPDs because they're extremely quick and hang out in dense scrub.", "Red-eyed vireo in Cold Lake Provincial Park.", "Cold Lake is apparently one of the best spots in Alberta to see turkey vultures.", "White-throated sparrows seem to like the same places as warblers do.", "The judges awarded full points for sticking the landing.", "House Wren", "Chipmunks are like mice except they're cute and people like them.", "Not exactly sure what this is but it's probably a finch or a grosbeak (by its bill).", "Not all spotted sandpipers have spots, Weed Lake.", "It's a sign summer is ending when you begin seeing flocks of birds, Weed Lake.", "We still think avocets are French. Their bill is like a pencil moustache. Taken at Weed Lake.", "Lesser yellow-legs at Weed Lake.", "We like butterflies because we associate them with summer."]
