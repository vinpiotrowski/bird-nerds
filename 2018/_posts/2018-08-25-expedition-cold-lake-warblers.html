words: "<p>One of the places on our bucket-list was Cold Lake Alberta because it is one of the best places to see a blackburnian warbler.  The provincial park is beautiful and filled with birds.  The thing about warblers is they hang out in the densest scrub brush and move around a lot making them incredibly challenging to photograph.  We saw several lifer warblers and we got a 2 day reprieve from the smoke that has been plaguing the province this Summer.</p>"
