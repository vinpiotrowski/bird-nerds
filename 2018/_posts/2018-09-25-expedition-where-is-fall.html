words: "<p>One of the best ways to get better at something is to teach other people.  On these trips we took a couple friends out with us.  We spotted lots of birds but the weather was miserable for most of September.  Lifer sightings included the long-billed curlew and Clark's grebe.  We also discovered a place in Black Diamond that makes artisan donuts on Saturdays so that was pretty cool too.</p>"
