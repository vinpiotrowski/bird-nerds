words: "<p>Like many Canadians the Bird Nerds have friends and family living on Vancouver Island and we like to visit them.  In between trips to restaurants and pubs we will sneak away and do some birding.  This trip was solid with several lifer sightings.  We tried to hit up parks that were on the ocean hoping to see some oceanic birds that we wouldn't likely see in Alberta.  Although we didn't spot anything unusual it was still fun to spend time staring out at the Pacific.</p>"

photo-descriptions: ["Pigeons are stunning, fast, and incredible navigators.", "The dark eye, the red dot on the bill, and the lack of black wing tips tell us this is a glaucous-winged gull.", "Black oystercatchers can be found along rocky shores from Alaska to Baja California.", "Originally we looked at this and thought it might be a mew gull but now we think it's a young ring-billed gull.", "We watched this gull catch and eat a crab. We think it's a glaucous-winged gull.", "Some migrating whimbrels make a nonstop flight of 4,000 km", "We didn't see the massive flocks of sandpipers like we thought we might but were happy to spot a least sandpiper.", "A fledgling northwestern crow looking pretty adorable.", "While staking out a kingfisher we ran into a pair of white-winged crossbills.", "Anna's hummingbirds are becoming more common on Vancouver Island.", "Bushtits are one of the smallest birds we've ever seen.", "You can identify a female bushtit by its pale eye.", "Juncos are an island staple and we saw several posing nicely.", "Mystery sparrow. Maybe a chipping sparrow?", "Song sparrows are really common on the island.", "On a trip to a local diner for pie we passed a big group of California quail. They're neat."]
