words: "<p>The Bird Nerds just flew South and spent 2 full days in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area in Arizona.  The scenery was awesome and the temperatures provided a great reprieve from Winter.  We saw some really cool birds and learned that there are some upsides to birding in a desert -- cacti don't have branches or leaves so birds are easier to spot!  One of our favorite sightings was a roadrunner!  The vermilion flycatcher is also one of the most striking birds we've ever seen.  Next stop Tuscon!</p>"
