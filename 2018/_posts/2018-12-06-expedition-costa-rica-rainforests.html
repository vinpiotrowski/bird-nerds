words: "<p>Part 2 of our Costa Rica adventure took us on very steep curvy roads, up into the mountains, where the cloud forests account for a large percentage of the world's biomass.  In Monte Verde the canopy was amazing but made it almost impossible to see birds.  We spent a couple days hiking in these beautiful ecological preserves and then went to lower altitudes in the middle elevations of Bijagua.  We got hit with some rain, however Bijagua was our favorite stop on the whole trip.  Not only is it a beautiful place but it had a quiet energy that was 'pura vida'.  We opted to relax on our balcony and drink coffee while wild toucans flew around in our yard.</p>"

photo-descriptions: ["The first toucan we spotted was a black-mindibled toucan. It was eating oranges in an orchard. It is the largest toucan in CR.", "Grackles are amazing and we've seen them in all our travels and at home as well.", "We were stunned when we saw our first red-legged honeycreeper in full breeding plumage.", "The montezuma oropendola has a great name and a unique appearance.", "The female red-legged honeycreeper might not be as stunning as the male but it's still pretty cool.", "On our CR adventures we saw many types of hummingbirds.", "The blue-gray tanager is one of the most common garden birds in Costa Rica.", "The summer tanager wins 'most red bird award'.", "Green honeycreepers caught our eye because no birds from Alberta have this shade of green.", "The white-throated magpie jay was much smaller than the magpie jays we've seen in Mexico.", "Toucans make a low croaking noise similar to a frog.  Did you spot the 2nd keel-billed toucan in the picture?", "Bees are the best.", "Rufous-tailed hummingbirds were everywhere in Bijagua.", "Collared aracari are a type of toucan that look like something out of a Tim Burton movie -- amazing!", "The black-crested coquette was our 2nd favourite hummingbird lifer sighting (snowcap were our favourite).", "Cattle egrets are a skittish bird but completely trust cows.", "The collared redstart is endemic to CR and western Panama.", "Tufted flycatchers are an adorable bird that we saw perched high in Santa Elena.", "Black-faced solitaires have a very unique call that makes them hard to locate."]
