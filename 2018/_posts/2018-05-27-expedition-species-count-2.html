words: "<p>This post's adventures happened in 3 parts: pre-Vancouver; the Vancouver trip; and then the May Species Count.  Vancouver was a bit of a wash because we birded in Stanley Park which should have been a gold mine but was empty.  This year we volunteered to do the species count in the Weaselhead Wildlife Area and it was great to do a deep dive on an area where we used to spend a lot of time.  We also had a lifer sighting (calliope hummingbird) which was awesome!</p>"
