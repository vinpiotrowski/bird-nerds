words: "<p>If you follow our adventures you know we're obsessed with burrowing owls.  Southeastern Alberta is EXPANSIVE and recent reports put the number of nests around 1000 in Canada so it's a long shot to say the least.  We've put an inordinate amount of effort looking for them and this weekend we launched another search.  Then it happened -- we saw a couple tiny birds moving across a field and they were burrowing owls!  The rest of the month was good too with shrikes, loons, and a couple close calls with orioles.  We saw two other lifers this month.</p><p><small>Note: we saw the owls east of Brooks but won't disclose exact locations.</small></p>"
