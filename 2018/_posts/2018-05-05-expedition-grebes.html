words: "<p>All of the birds are back!  It's like someone flipped a switch and turned on all the birds.  We've seen many blackbirds, wrens, tree swallows, bluebirds, robins etc.  Online people are reporting tanagers and orioles.  It's also been warm out!  To top it off we spotted two new lifers -- the evening grosbeak and the horned grebe.</p>"

photo-descriptions: ["It's probably pretty common for birders to visit Alberta hoping to see magpies.", "Common goldeneye tilt their head far back and make croaking sounds.", "We think robins have brighter chests earlier in the season.", "Our sparrow ID skills are a bit rusty after a long winter. It took a second for us to recall what a savannah sparrow looked like.", "Red-winged blackbirds are another sign of Spring.", "Spring is locked in when yellow-headed blackbirds show up.", "It's not uncommon for birds to land on us while we're birding.", "Some birders don't care about ducks but we think they're great.", "Winter wrens are dark, small, and very noisy.", "Tree swallows nest in tree cavities; they also readily take up residence in nest boxes.", "Its 'horns' are yellowish patches of feathers that it can raise and lower at will.", "Likes include: dandelions, goslings and honking. Dislikes include: everything else!", "We always check out wigeons hoping to see the eurasian variety.", "On a trip to Carburn Park in Calgary a handful of Franklin's Gulls were acting like ducks near shore.", "I wonder if the Brewer's blackbird is named for someone who makes beer. I hope so."]
