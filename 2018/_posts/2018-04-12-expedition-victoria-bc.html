words: "<p>So far the Spring season in Calgary has been horrible -- snow, more snow, and cold temperatures.  March was almost 10 degrees colder on average than normal and it's taken a lot of willpower to go outside.  We finally broke our no-lifer streak with a first sighting in Alberta (snow bunting). In mid-April we flew to Vancouver Island to visit friends and family and got a taste of Spring and did a little birding.  Most of these pictures are from the island.</p>"
